# Packaging

## winget manifests

The three files in `winget/` are the package as
[microsoft/winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs) wants it: a version
manifest that routes, an installer manifest, and a default-locale manifest that carries
everything `winget show` prints.

They live here rather than only in the pull request so that the values that have to be right
— the identifier, the switches, the scope, the licence, the tags — are reviewed in the same
repository as the thing they describe, and so that the next version is a diff rather than a
rewrite.

## Why winget at all

An unsigned installer downloaded in a browser gets a SmartScreen warning, and the warning is
the one a first-time user reads as "this is malware". `winget install` does not go through
the browser and does not raise it. Until SignPath Foundation approves the certificate
(`docs/CODE_SIGNING.md`), winget is the install path this project points people at, and
`README.md` says so in those words.

winget accepts unsigned installers. It requires the download to be reachable over HTTPS and
to match `InstallerSha256` exactly, which is a weaker promise than a signature — it says the
bytes are the ones the manifest was written for, not who built them — but it is the promise
that is available today, and it is checked on every install.

## Before submitting

`InstallerSha256` in `xfurqan0.nazar-tray.installer.yaml` is sixty-four zeros. It cannot be
anything else until the release exists: it is the hash of a file that is uploaded in the
step before. `docs/RELEASE.md` is the checklist, and step 6 is where the real hash goes in.

Validate locally first — this needs no network and no account:

```powershell
winget validate --manifest packaging\winget
```

Then, with the release published and the hash filled in:

```powershell
# Installs from the manifest as a user would, and checks the hash against the download.
winget install --manifest packaging\winget
```

## Submitting

The pull request goes to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`, under
`manifests/x/xfurqan0/nazar-tray/0.1.0/`. `wingetcreate` does the fork, the branch and the
pull request in one command:

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.WingetCreate --exact
wingetcreate submit --token <a GitHub PAT with public_repo> packaging\winget
```

**The pull request text is a message that leaves this machine.** It is written by the
maintainer, read before it is sent, and carries no AI attribution — same rule as every commit
in this repository.

## The identifier

`xfurqan0.nazar-tray` uses the GitHub account name as the publisher half, which is the usual
shape for a single-maintainer project. The `Publisher` field in the locale manifest is
`Furkan Yıldız`, matching `LICENSE` and the installer's own file properties. The two are
deliberately not the same string: a `PackageIdentifier` may hold neither a space nor a
diacritic, so agreeing with the display name would mean `FurkanYildiz.nazar-tray`, and
changing the identifier later means a new package rather than a new version — worth settling
in the first pull request if a reviewer asks for it.

The bundle identifier is a third, unrelated name: `io.github.xfurqan0.nazar-tray`, stamped by
`crates/nazar-tray/tauri.conf.json` and read by Windows, not by winget.

## Why this file is not inside `winget/`

`winget validate --manifest <directory>` parses **every** file in the directory it is given,
not only the `.yaml` ones — a Markdown heading is a YAML scanner error, and the message it
produces (`mapping values are not allowed in this context`) points at a line number in a file
you were not thinking about. So the directory holds the three manifests and nothing else, and
the prose lives one level up.
