# Changelog

Notable changes to nazar-tray. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

`limits.json` has its own compatibility promise, separate from the app version: see
[docs/limits-contract.md](docs/limits-contract.md).

## [Unreleased]

Nothing released yet. The repository holds the WP0 skeleton: it builds, it tests, and the
tray opens an empty panel.

### Added

- Cargo workspace: `nazar-core` (pure Rust, no Tauri, builds everywhere) and `nazar-tray`
  (the Tauri v2 application, Windows first).
- `limits.json` contract at `schemaVersion: 1` — serde types, an atomic writer
  (temporary file plus rename) and a reader, with the contract written down in
  `docs/limits-contract.md` and a sample in `fixtures/limits.sample.json`.
- Tray icon with a placeholder bead, and a frameless popup panel that opens near the
  cursor on either mouse button and closes on Esc or on losing focus.
- Panel built from plain TypeScript, HTML and CSS with esbuild — no framework
  (decision K2).
- i18n scaffolding: `locales/{en,tr}.json` written by hand, `{zh,ko,ru,es}.json` as empty
  placeholders, a `t()` helper with `{placeholder}` interpolation, and a language guess.
  EN/TR parity is a test; the four pending languages are reported, not failed (WP6).
- Theme tokens copied verbatim from Nazar (`theme.nazar.json`, `theme.graphite.json`)
  with a test asserting the four bead hexes (decision K23).
- CI: Windows lint, test and build as the gate; Ubuntu and macOS running `nazar-core`
  only; the Windows debug bundle as a non-blocking artifact job (risk R1).
- Repository hygiene: `.gitattributes`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `rustfmt.toml`, `deny.toml`
  and `scripts/check-licenses.mjs`, which fails on any dependency that is not permissively
  licensed.

### Notes

- The tray shows a static bead. The bead that fills from the bottom with the binding
  window is WP4 (decision K3, drawn in Rust per scale factor).
- `tauri-plugin-notification`, `tauri-plugin-autostart` and `tauri-plugin-updater` are
  declared but not initialised. They are wired in WP5 and WP7.
